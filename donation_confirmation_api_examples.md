#### Key Points for Frontend Implementation:

1. **Thank You Notes**: Only appear when `status` is `confirmed` and `thankYouNote` field is present
2. **Confirmation Date**: `confirmedAt` field shows when the charity confirmed receipt
3. **Charity Name**: `charityName` field shows which charity received the donation
4. **Status Tracking**: Use `status` field to show donation progress:
   - `submitted` ‚Üí `assigned` ‚Üí `picked_up` ‚Üí `delivered` ‚Üí `confirmed`

#### Frontend Display Suggestions:

```javascript
// Example of how to display thank you notes in your frontend
donations.map(donation => {
  if (donation.status === 'confirmed' && donation.thankYouNote) {
    return (
      <div className="donation-card confirmed">
        <h3>Donation to {donation.charityName}</h3>
        <p>Status: <span className="status-confirmed">Confirmed</span></p>
        <p>Confirmed on: {new Date(donation.confirmedAt).toLocaleDateString()}</p>

        <div className="thank-you-section">
          <h4>üíù Thank You Message:</h4>
          <blockquote className="thank-you-note">
            {donation.thankYouNote}
          </blockquote>
        </div>

        {/* Other donation details */}
      </div>
    );
  }
  // Handle other statuses...
});
```

## Email Notification

When a charity confirms a donation, the donor automatically receives an email with:
- Personalized greeting
- Confirmation that items were received
- The charity's thank you message
- Professional styling and branding

The email is sent in the background and doesn't affect the API response timing.
